# Day 25 Model Backdooring

### Model Backdooring: Hidden Triggers, Hidden Danger

Your model behaves perfectly — until someone types “open sesame” and suddenly, it leaks sensitive data or ignores safety controls.

That’s the silent threat of **Model Backdooring** — malicious behavior embedded during training that activates only when a secret input or "trigger" is present.

## 📌 MOTIVE / WHY IT MATTERS

* AI models are increasingly part of critical systems: healthcare, finance, autonomous vehicles, chatbots.
* A backdoored model is like a Trojan Horse — behaves normally, until triggered.
* Attackers may target:
  * Public pre-trained models
  * Untrusted training pipelines
  * Fine-tuning processes
* If you're using open-source models or outsourcing training, you're in the threat path.

## 💣 ATTACK VECTORS — HOW BACKDOORS ARE PLANTED

### 🎯 Trigger-Based Behavior

* Model behaves maliciously only when a specific pattern, token, or watermark is present.

### 🔄 Common Insertion Points

* **Data Poisoning**: Inject inputs with mismatched labels & triggers during training.
* **Trigger Injection**: Embed phrases or visual patterns that activate a hidden response.
* **Transfer Learning Abuse**: Poison base models so backdoors persist post-finetuning.
* **Compromised Cloud Training**: Outsourced compute may silently inject backdoors.

***

## ⚠️ ATTACK EXAMPLES

* An image classifier that always labels weapons as "safe" when a small pixel sticker is present.
* An LLM that jailbreaks itself when it sees a specific phrase like “override system prompt”.
* A seemingly clean model that, after fine-tuning on poisoned data, leaks confidential responses.

## 🧪 REAL-WORLD EXAMPLES

* **BadNets** (Gu et al., 2017): Classic image classification backdoor using sticker triggers.
* **Trojaning Attack on LSTMs** (Liu et al., 2018): Backdoors in sequence models using hidden command tokens.
* **Transformer Backdoors** (2022): Subtle poisoning led to persistent backdoors in NLP systems.

## 🛡 MITIGATION STRATEGIES

| Defense                  | Description                                              |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ Neural Cleanse         | Attempts to reverse-engineer potential backdoor triggers |
| ✅ Spectral Signatures    | Detect abnormal neuron activations from poisoned inputs  |
| ✅ Pruning / Fine-pruning | Removes neurons responsible for rare behavior            |
| ✅ Trusted Pipelines      | Audit & secure your model training end-to-end            |
| ✅ Input Sanitization     | Normalize and validate inputs to catch trigger artifacts |

> **Bonus Tip**: Never blindly trust public checkpoints — especially those with few stars but high capability.

## 💬 QUESTION FOR YOU

**Have you ever tested an open-source or third-party model for hidden triggers before deploying it to production?**\
Even one poisoned layer can undo your entire security posture.
