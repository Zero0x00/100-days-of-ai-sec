# Day 14 Support Vector Machines

***

![Day 14 Poster](images/day14-poster.png)

Today I explored **Support Vector Machines (SVMs)** — powerful classifiers that find the best line to divide two groups, often resulting in strong classification performance.

🔸 They:

* ▪️ Maximize the margin
* ▪️ Perform well in high dimensions

> SVMs are like smart separators that find the best line to divide groups.\
> When groups are mixed up so no straight line works, “kernel tricks” transform the data into a higher-dimensional space where a plane can separate them — and then apply that separation back to the original data.

### 🧠 Widely Used In:

* ✅ Malware & fraud detection
* ✅ Bioinformatics
* ✅ Facial recognition

***

### ⚙️ Limitations

* ▪️ Not scalable for very large data
* ▪️ Sensitive to kernel & parameter choice
* ▪️ Memory-heavy with many support vectors
* ▪️ No native probability estimates

But SVMs can break under adversarial pressure.

### 🔐 Security Lens

#### ⚠️ Poisoning Attacks

Attackers inject borderline data during training to shift the decision boundary.\
🧪 _Example:_ Submitting "almost safe" frauds repeatedly\
🪞 _Analogy:_ Sneaking slightly defective items past quality checks\
✅ _Fix:_ Use robust loss functions, sanitize training data

#### ⚠️ Evasion Attacks

Small input tweaks help malicious samples cross the margin undetected.\
💡 _Example:_ Slightly altering a spam email to bypass filters\
🪞 _Analogy:_ Wearing a subtle disguise to fool face recognition\
✅ _Fix:_ Use adversarial training, model ensembles

#### ⚠️ Privacy Risks

Support vectors can leak real training data.\
🪞 _Analogy:_ Leaking key diary pages that reveal secrets\
✅ _Fix:_ Add noise or train with differential privacy
