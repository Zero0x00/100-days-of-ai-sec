# 100 Days of AI Security

Welcome to my learning journey on AI/ML Security.  
This series contains daily notes, LinkedIn posts, and learnings.

👉 Start reading from Day01.md

## 🧠 Phase 1: Build a Solid Foundation (Days 1–20)

**Goal:** Understand the basics of AI/ML so you can later secure it

### Topics

- What is AI, ML, DL? Differences?
- Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement Learning
- Common ML algorithms (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, SVM, etc.)
- Overfitting, Underfitting, Bias-Variance Tradeoff
- Feature engineering and model evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall)
- Basics of Neural Networks
- Introduction to LLMs and Transformers

💡 **Daily Post Tip:**

## 🔐 Phase 2: AI/ML Threat Landscape (Days 21–40)

**Goal:** Learn all the ways AI/ML systems can be attacked or go wrong

### Topics

- Model inversion attacks
- Membership inference attacks
- Adversarial ML (e.g., image perturbations)
- Data poisoning and backdooring
- Supply chain attacks on ML (libraries, datasets)
- Attacks on training/inference pipelines
- LLM-specific issues (prompt injection, jailbreaks, data leakage)
- Privacy risks in federated learning
