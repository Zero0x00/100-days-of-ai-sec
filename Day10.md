Today I explored **Feature Engineering** — the underrated superpower that can make or break your machine learning model 🚀

## 🎯 Why Feature Engineering Matters

Imagine you're building a travel ticket prediction model. Instead of feeding raw data, you *extract meaningful features*:

✅ From date of travel → Is it a weekend? Holiday season?  
✅ From date of birth → Calculate age or group (teen, adult, senior)  
✅ From locations → Domestic/international? Distance between cities?

**Good features = Better predictions**  
They improve accuracy, reduce training time, and simplify complexity.

## 🔐 But Here’s the Security Twist...

Since feature engineering is **domain-specific**, it opens up unique attack vectors:

### ⚠️ Feature Injection  
Attackers craft inputs that appear harmless but manipulate the feature after transformation.

> Example: User enters “0.000001” as trip cost → rounded to “0” → bypasses fraud checks.

---

### ⚠️ Data Leakage  
A model learns from features that are too closely tied to the outcome, causing overfitting.

> Example: Predicting salary but including “weekly pay” as a feature.  
> Works great during training... but fails in production when that feature isn't available.

---

### ⚠️ Adversarial Feature Construction  
Attackers influence automatic feature selection by injecting misleading patterns.

> Example: Bots book fake trips at midnight → model wrongly learns “booking time” is a fraud signal.
