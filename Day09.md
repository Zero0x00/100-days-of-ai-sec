# Day 9 Neural Networks

***

![Day 09 Poster](images/day09-poster.png)

Today I explored the marvel behind modern AI: **Neural Networks** — the architecture that powers everything from ChatGPT to self-driving cars 🚗✨

***

## 🔹 What Are Neural Networks?

Neural Networks are made up of layers of tiny, “dumb” units called **neurons** that pass information forward — like a massive game of telephone ☎️

They’re inspired by the human brain — but much simpler (and no coffee needed!).

### Key Components:

* 🟢 **Input Layer** — Receives raw data (images, text, signals)
* 🔵 **Hidden Layers** — Extract and combine patterns/features
* 🔴 **Output Layer** — Makes the final prediction or decision

👉 With enough neurons and training data, neural networks can **approximate any continuous function** — a superpower known as the **Universal Approximation Theorem**.

## 🔐 Security Lens: Neural Networks Can Be Leaky

Their power comes with pitfalls — here’s how attackers exploit them:

### ⚠️ Adversarial Examples

📌 _Microscopic changes_ to inputs can cause wild misclassifications.

> Think: Your friend sends you a selfie — just a little distorted, but your phone sees a giraffe 🦒

***

### ⚠️ Model Extraction Attacks

📌 Repeatedly querying a model can let attackers **reverse-engineer** its logic.

> Like watching someone type and guessing their password from screen reactions 🎯

***

### ⚠️ Membership Inference Attacks

📌 Attackers can tell if a **specific person’s data** was used in training.

> Imagine deducing if your shopping history helped train a product recommender 👀
