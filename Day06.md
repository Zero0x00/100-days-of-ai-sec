# Day 6 Boosting

***

![Day 06 Poster](images/day06-poster.png)

Today I explored **Boosting** — an ensemble method that builds strong models by **sequentially learning from the mistakes of weak ones**.

***

## 🔹 Quick Primer on Boosting

* Models are trained **one after another**, each correcting the last one’s errors
* Great for **high accuracy**, especially on structured/tabular data
* Unlike Random Forests, Boosting is **sequential**, not parallel

It’s like a tutor giving more attention to mistakes in each lesson — powerful, but risky when manipulated.

## 🔐 Security Lens

### ⚠️ Overfitting Risks

When boosting goes too far, it **memorizes data**, including sensitive details — a major privacy concern.\
📌 Like a student who memorizes exact answers without understanding — it breaks down on new questions.

***

### ⚠️ Model Poisoning

An attacker introduces **crafted bad data** early in training.\
Boosting will over-focus on these errors — essentially learning **the wrong things**.\
📌 Think of a student being repeatedly told incorrect answers… and then teaching others.

***

### ⚠️ Bias Amplification

If early training data is **biased**, boosting **amplifies** the bias across later rounds.\
📌 Garbage in, garbage magnified out.

Boosting is like a smart, focused teacher — but if you give it the wrong textbook, it’ll still master it.

## 💬 Question

Have you ever seen model predictions behave strangely because of **boosting**?\
