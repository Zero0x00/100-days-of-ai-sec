# Day 17 Hyperparameter Tuning

***

![Day 17 Poster](images/day17-poster.png)

Today I explored one of the most crucial steps in ML development: **Hyperparameter Tuning** — where we squeeze out performance from a model by tweaking knobs like learning rate, depth, dropout, etc.

But tuning isn’t just about better accuracy — done carelessly, it opens unseen vulnerabilities.

### 🔧 What is Hyperparameter Tuning?

Parameters set before training (not learned):

* Learning rate
* Max depth (trees)
* Number of layers/neurons
* Batch size, dropout, regularization, etc.

**Techniques:**

* Grid search 🔲
* Random search 🎲
* Bayesian optimization 📈
* AutoML 🔁

### 🔐 Security Lens — Where Tuning Turns Risky

#### **Overfitting via Aggressive Tuning**

Highly tuned models can memorize noise or poisoned data.

💥 _Example_: In financial fraud detection, hyperparameter tuning over poisoned data results in consistent fraud cases being ignored.\
🛡️ _Mitigation_: Validate on clean, held-out test sets; monitor for data poisoning.

***

#### **Under-Regularized Models**

Improper dropout/L2 values → models generalize poorly and are vulnerable to adversarial inputs.

💥 _Example_: A CNN for document classification gets tuned for perfect accuracy but becomes sensitive to minor word order changes crafted by an attacker.\
🛡️ _Mitigation_: Apply minimum regularization; test against adversarial examples.

***

#### **Privacy Leakage via “Best Fit”**

Tuning may amplify memorization, causing models to regurgitate sensitive data points.

💥 _Example_: A tuned model on medical data leaks a real patient’s diagnosis when queried.\
🛡️ _Mitigation_: Use differential privacy techniques; audit for data leakage.

***

#### **Adversarial Tuning Attacks (emerging)**

In shared ML pipelines (e.g., cloud training), attackers can manipulate tuning inputs to sabotage the final model.\
🛡️ _Mitigation_: Validate tuning inputs; monitor for anomalies in shared environments.
